##  <span style="color:grey"> __Final Round of our Tic-Tac-Toe-Coding-Challenge__ </span>

<br>

We have started the last round of our Coding Challenge with the same Teams as before
- time to do some final implementations and some problem solving up to 12:00
- short conversation about how we feel in general with coding for the last weeks

##  <span style="color:grey"> __Game Presentations__ </span>

#### 1.) Team Markus and Jaad:
- had a nice working game
- nice little feature of the infinite loop :)

#### 2.) Team Shahi and Grace

- game worked also very well
- stops after the round is finished
- Shahi would like to ad a function to ask for another round
- used floor division for calculation of the indexes 
- grace added a dynamic feature to expand the game board (e.g. 9x9 with then 81 spots :) )

#### 3.) Team Ricarda and ?:

- also created a very nice game
- asking for players names and to call them every time when its their turn 
- also added colors to the names so they stand out (but not yet for the symbols) using colorama
- also had some problems first with the global variables and then manage to replace them (now calling them in the functions)

#### 4.) Team Lana and Ana:

- again a very nice game
- also asked for players names
- created a function which randomly determines who is player 1 and who is player 2
- used Data Frames instead of Lists to present the game board therefor imported them from pandas library
- also had a score counter and the game is asking for another round after the round is finished

#### At the end Konni asked for our Learnings:

- some of us didn't like the pseydocode too much and also switched to write the code right away more and more
