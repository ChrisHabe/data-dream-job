<br>

Every pair continued working on their Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation.  

* Design and testing of basic working game that can be played on the terminal.

* Trying to implement more game functionalities based on team inspiration and time. For instance: 

    - Diverse player options (Human and Computer players).

    - Encapsulation: Organization of codes using classes.

    - Dynamic game board based on player preference.

    - Game interface using Python modules such as [Pygame], Pgzero], Pyscript etc.

Andreas proposed a suggestion, that the pairs with a working code for  the Tic-Tac-Toe game could implement:

* To program an automatic adversary.
* Refactor their code in order to improve the code quality.
* He shared a link containing crucial points on improving the code quality as a good programmer. 

    - It explains the usefulness of having a maintainable and easily understandable code.

    - It detailed the standard conventions for code design, naming and function rules.
    
    - It detailed error handling, unit testing and much more.

* Jan shared links to python workouts that contains about 50 ten-minute exercises and also a youtube video on how to collapse codeblocks on VSCode for easy navigation when handling scripts with long lines of codes.
