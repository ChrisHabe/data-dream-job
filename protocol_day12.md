## <span style="color:black"> __Survey Ana and Jaad__ </span>

* At the beginning of our lecture, Ana and Jaad presented the results of their survey "Music Habbits"

    - very nice presentation with good and clean layout
    
    - most of us:
        
        - between 30 and 40 years old and yet buy music via streaming providers
        
        - preferred music genre is rock with 67%, followed by classic (requested for multiple answers)
        
        - spend less then 25â‚¬ / month on music
        
        - believe that music influences our moods


* Takeaways for our future presentations

    - use as less text as possible (e.g. for introductions)
    
    - uniform order of attributes in charts (also in response options with linear scales)
    
    - avoid "Unhappy Flow" (Questions that interrupt or distract from the core of the survey)
    
    - use `=SORT` function to arrange attributes in charts in ascending or descending order

## <span style="color:black"> __Solving analytical Problems__ </span>

* Prioritisation - determine wich problem to tackle first and wich later
   
    - use the Impact / Frequency Matrix 
        
        - choose the problems which occurs most frequently and has the biggest impact with its solution
    
    - apply the 80-20 rule for this (Pareto Principle)
    
        - 80% of all outcomes are derived from 20% of causes
    
        - Vital Few vs. Useful Many


* Workflow - is hardly ever a linear one
    
    - Lifecycle of Data Analytics
        
        1. Understand the business
        
        2. Define the solution with the appropriate hypothesis
        
        3. Get the Data
        
        4. Work with the Data to confirm or reject your hypothesis
        
        5. Visualize the Data and present results 
        
            - leads to better understanding and possible new ways to improve the business
        
        1. ..
    
    - plan backwards and solve forwards - before you execute u have to plan first!
        
        - start with the outcome when planning 
        
        - start with the data when solving

    - know where to start
        
        - Input -> Predictions (from Training/Experience) -> combine Predictions with the Judgement -> Actions -> Outcome
        
        - Example "Anatomy of a Decision" (visit a doctor)
        
            1. Examination by the doctor = Input
        
            2. Based on his experience he can narrow down the possible causes = Prediction
        
            3. Decide for one cause = Judge
        
            4. Prescribe therapy = Action
        
            5. Therapy was successful or not = Outcome


* Root Cause Analysis
    
    - is the system of drilling down to get to the heart of an issue
    
        ![Root_Cause](images/root_cause.png)
    
    - The 5 Whys
    
        - is a method that explores the underlying cause-and-effect of particular problems
    
        - in average you need to ask why? five times to get to the root cause
    
        - ![5 Whys](images/5_whys.png)
    
    - Tree Diagram 
    
        - describes levels or categories of causes
    
        - there can be more then one symptom of a problem and also multiple (possible) root causes
    
        - once root causes are identified, they can be systematically eliminated
    
        - developing a tree diagram helps to move the thinking from generalities to specifics

    - Fish Bone Analysis
    
        - is a cause and effect diagram with six main factors
    
        - has even more causes for each main factor
    
        - difficult to analyze and to determine what the true cause is

## <span style="color:black"> __Group Exercise "5 Why's"__ </span>

* the task was to first slip into the role of the consultant and ask our partner probing questions about a chosen problem

* we had to rephrase their answers into further questions leading to even more questions

* the goal was to get to the root cause so that we could then find a possible solution

* afterwards the roles were exchanged

## <span style="color:black"> __Takeaways__ </span>

- avoid going down question paths that do not get at elements related to the person or controllable elements of the process

- if the branch you choose does not result in a useful answer, use different lines of questioning

- don't get into a rabbit hole resulting in an infinite amount of Why Questions 

- [Examples for Why Questions](https://www.taproot.com/best-5-why-examples/)

- MECE = Mutual Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive -> principle to describe a way of organizing information and helps solve complex problems
